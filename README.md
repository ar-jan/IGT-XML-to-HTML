IGT-XML-to-HTML
===============

IGT-XML is an XML format for representing interlinearlized glossed text (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1642059.1642087). This repository contains an XSL script to transform basic IGT-XML into HTML tables that can be easily read, as the following screenshot shows.

A test site has also been included with an excerpt of an IGT-XML corpus and the html generated from it.
